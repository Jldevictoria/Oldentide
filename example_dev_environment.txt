Example Development Environment (@hintron's dev setup):

OS Environment:
    Linux (Debian - debian-8.5.0-amd64-netinst.iso) running on Oracle VM VirtualBox with 768 MB base memory in Windows 10

Tools:
    To install, log in as root:
        su root
    Then do:
        apt-get install {package}

    Required Packages:
        make
        git
        sqlite3
        libsqlite3-dev      # Dev just means that a "sqlite3.h" is put into /usr/include/, so it can be included in code development
        libssl-dev
        g++

    Important packages:
        valgrind
        vim

    Optional Packages:
        strace
        linux-tools      #(For perf)
        gdc
        nasm


    Note: You need to have both sqlite3 installed (to create the initial db) and libsqlite3-dev (for #include <sqlite3.h>)
