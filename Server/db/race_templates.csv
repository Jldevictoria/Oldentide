Dwarves tend to have high Strength - and excel at classes that require a high Constitution.  Many Dwarves are skilled crafters - but often lack the Dexterity required in ranged combat.  Dwarves are of average Intelligence - so their good Strength and Constitution often lead them into more physical pursuits.

Elves tend to excel in Dexterity based skills - but tend to have less Strength and Constitution than many of the other races of Vormis.  They are inclined more toward spellcasting and ranged combat than an average human - and often learn a combination of magical and martial skills.

Gnomes have a natural talent for spellcasting - though they are not as specialized as Leshy.  Gnomes have a low Constitution - but tend to have high Dexterity and high Intelligence. They are stronger than Leshy - and are best suited for character classes that are based on Intelligence or Dexterity.

They are of average Strength - Dexterity - Intelligence and Constitution.  Humans are not adept at any one type of skill and can learn most any skill for an average amount of effort and time.  They are most suited for character classes that do not require multiple Attributes to be well above average.

Leshy tend to be highly Intelligent and are naturally adept at spellcasting.  They are physically weak - especially in Strength - though they are of average Dexterity.  Leshy are best suited for character classes that do not rely directly on Strength or Constitution.

Known for their immense Strength and lack of Intelligence - ogres are suprisingly good natured.  Though ogres were recently accepted as a civilized race of Vormis - they often work well with others - and excel at physical skills.  Ogres are best suited for skills and character classes that rely on Strength or Constitution - and they tend to be poor spellcasters.

Orcs were recently accepted as a civilized race - though there are still orcs in the wilds of Vormis with no love of civilization.  Orcs tend to have a high Dexterity - fairly high Strength and Constitution - but often lack Intelligence.  While they can become spellcasters - orcs are best suited for character classes that are based on physical traits.
