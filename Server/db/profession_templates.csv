They do not have any particular difficulty or ease with any one magic skill or school - but tend to be practiced in Spellcraft and Focus.  They are quick to pick up Language skills.  Many mages believe that all magic comes from the same place - rather than each school from a separate origin.  Whatever their beliefs - they are considered the spellcasting equivalent of the Mercenary.

Magicians are adept at Focus and Spellcraft - Enchanting and Lore. The Etherial schools deal more with the non-corporeal aspects of magic - rather than in Terrestrial magic - and each school enchants items differently to reflect the way that type of magic works.

Most Mercenaries will decide which weapons and styles they wish to concentrate on learning early in their career - as learning all of the skills at once is too much for any one lifetime.

Mountains - streams and rivers - even some fields and other areas are good places to find certain types of metals and gems.  A Miner concentrates on learning the Mining trade - but also relies on other skills to defend against the elements or foes who might attack.  Miners often pick up the Axe skill as a melee weapon - since they often have a pick or Axe in hand.

Minstrels are not particularly skilled at weapons skills - preferring to avoid combat whenever possible.  They are most skilled in Bardic magic - followed by Shamanic and Illusion - while Summoning is their worst school of magic.  They have a strong talent for the Worldly skills.

They tend to study either unarmed combat or the quarterstaff - as well as healing arts - but they are not warriors and rarely wear heavy armor.  Monastaries tend to be repositories of knowledge - and Monks exposed to such an environment often copy texts by hand or memorize them.  Monks are often fairly scholarly individuals who travel the realms looking for others to aid - or doing kind deeds - and as such Monks tend to have a good reputation in towns and cities.  Many take a vow of poverty - giving much of what they find to the needy.

Outlaws usually have bad reputations in most civilizations - so they shouldn't expect to be welcomed into all places - though they may be welcome where others of better reputation are not.  Outlaws are equally adept at almost all weapon skills - and learn Armor and Dual Weapon easily.  Outlaws find Stealth and Pick Locks easy to learn - as these skills come up often when living on the run.

Not all spears are two handed - so a Pikeman should consider what to learn early in his or her career.  Pikemen tend to be good at Armorsmithing and Weaponsmithing to support their calling.  They are very poor spell casters - relying mainly on the reach of their weapons to keep a foe away from their allies.

They are adept at learning languages - somewhat adept at learning magic schools - and they find Focus and Lore very easy to learn.  They favor Calligraphy of all of the crafting skills - and they have some aptitude for Bargaining and Search.  Scholars are not naturally skilled at combat skills - usually shunning physical pursuits for those more mentally oriented.

Rogues and Thieves approach their level of competence at some of them - but a Scoundrel performs any of them with the aptitude of a specialist.  Unfortunately - this broad training has left them somewhat lacking when it comes to combat and magic - though they have less of a problem using light melee weapons and casting Illusion spells.  They make adequate crafters - and some have found that learning languages helps them in their travels.

Thus - a Scout excels at Stealth and Scouting.  Stealth allows a Scout to go unseen - while Scout allows a person to interpret monster behavior and to determine important strengths and weaknesses of a foe.  Scouts tend towards ranged weapons or lighter melee weapons - and have surprisingly little trouble learning magic for a fighting profession.

They are adept at learning Spellcraft and Focus - Search - and Lore.  They are abysmally weak in the areas of physical combat.  While a specialized Bard - Druid - or Shaman might be more powerful in one specific school by focussing their studies - the Seer has the advantage of versatility.

They are naturally adept at casting Shamaic magic - as well as at Spellcraft and Focus.  While their peaceful ways tend to leave them little aptitude in physical combat against most enemies - they can use Shamanic magic to great effect against undead.  A strong ally is still the best defense against foes for a Shaman.  They have minor talents in Enchanting - Calligraphy - and Alchemy - but excel at First Aid.

They tend to be heavily armored melee combatants that favor axes and hammers - and use their powers to rally their allies.  Excelling at both - they must balance furthering their abilities in melee combat with advancing their magical skills.  Skalds tend to be rather poor at ranged combat - having little time to study such things - and find it difficult to learn schools other than Bardic - especially the opposition school of Summoning magic.  Of the Bardic spellcasters - Skalds are by far the most oriented towards melee combat.

A Slinger can develop great accuracy and range with his or her chosen weapon - for little cost and material.  Fletching is a secondary skill that many Slingers find invaluable.  Slingers are poor spellcasters - but have little trouble learning Worldly or Crafting skills of any type.

A Soldier will find it equally easy to learn any type of weapon or martial style - though learning all at once is not advised. Weaponsmithing - Armorsmithing - and Fletching are all useful secondary skills for a Soldier - as is Camping and possibly First Aid.

They have a natural talent for Sorcery - and can use it to cast impressive damaging spells.  Sorcerers are very weak in physical combat - instead relying on their spells to kill enemies at range.  Sorcerers find it fairly easy to learn the adjacent schools of magic - Illusion and Necromancy - but Spellcraft and Focus are the most important secondary skills for a Sorcerer to learn.

The core ideas of chivalry are usually held close to their hearts - and tend to strive to be examples for others.  They primarily focus on melee weapon skills - such as Sword - Axe - or Hammer - and train in wearing heavy Armor - sometimes with a Shield - though some use two handed weapons instead.  They are not skilled with ranged weapons - and magic skills are very difficult for them to learn.  Weaponsmithing and Armorsmithing are useful secondary skills to a Squire - as they enable him or her to fix weapons when traveling outside cities and towns.

Many Swashbucklers exchange Dexterity and freedom of movement for the safety of heavy Armor - instead sometimes learning Dual Weapon or simply concentrating on Swords.  Some of the Worldly Skills come easily to them - and most Swashbucklers will only learn magic for visual effects - not spending an extraordinary amount of time studying it when there are masses to impress with your swordplay.

Most Sycophants have a "honeyed tongue" - and thus - language skills come easily to them.  Bargaining is key to the Sycophant - as they would often rather bargain than risk a fair fight.  Always scheming to advance their social position - many of the Worldly skills come easily to a Sycophant - and the magical arts are far easier for them to learn than military matters - which involve getting one's hands dirty and involve far more risk.

Unlike them - however - Wardens are not gifted with magical talents.  They are adept with weapons of all types - and tend towards heavier armor.  Wardens are adept at Camping and First Aid - as well as in Herbalism.

Weaponsmiths tend to be strong individuals that fight well with the hammers they use in their art - but make weak spellcasters.  As specialists of their craft - they have the easiest time learning Weaponsmithing of any profession - though they tend to learn Armorsmithing quicker than most - as many techniques they use are duplicated in that craft.  They tend to be adept at Mining - as well as at Traps.

Summoners often come into contact with them - but it is the Zealots of Vormis that seek out this forbidden lore.  They tend towards secrecy - and deter inquiries to their activites with violent displays of prowess with the daggers that have become their trademarks.  Zealots excel at the use of daggers - and are adept at chanting in all of the tongues. They  have a knack for Lore and Stealth - and though they are not especially proficient casters - they tend to favor Summoning over the other schools of magic.
