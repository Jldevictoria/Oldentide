First, install nodejs on Ubuntu/Debian. This assumes Nodejs 6.x.
See https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions

    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

Then cd to Oldentide/Server/Website/ and run:

    npm install
    sudo node index.js

Then open a browser and navigate to:

    localhost

You can log in as an admin, see Oldentide account data if you are logged in, and log out.
This simple web server demonstrates accessing the Oldentide database via node and printing sqlite records to a client browser.
This also demonstrates persistent sessions using sqlite as the session store. This will be needed for proper authentication later.
