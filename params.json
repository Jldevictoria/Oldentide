{"name":"Oldentide","tagline":"A Game Where You Can Be Anyone.","body":"###Philosophy\r\nOldentide is a multiplayer online role playing game (morpg) themed after traditional worldwide folk lore and \"Tolkein-style\" fantasy.  \r\n\r\nOne of the key goals of the game is to create a world where players are free to become the kind of character they desire.  Role play is highly encouraged, as well as facilitated through the unique character creation system.  Core tenets of this system are:\r\n\r\n* 7+ Distinct races.\r\n* 100+ Character professions.\r\n* 100+ Unique skills.\r\n* No hard level cap.\r\n* Free to play.  \r\n* Open source (GPL).\r\n* Private servers allowed, but not necessarily encouraged.\r\n* Small-town in game community. (100-200 online players is the goal)\r\n\r\nCore inspirations for this game are drawn from the game Rubies of Eventide. (2003-2009)  Rubies of Eventide was the first game to exhibit the impressive breadth of character development that we are emulating in Oldentide.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
