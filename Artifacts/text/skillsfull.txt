#Martial Skills
 
Weapon skills, fighting styles and the Armor skill are considered to be Martial Skills. Martial skills are important to characters that are oriented more towards fighting than spellcasting or other non-physical pursuits. As a fighter, make sure you choose at least one melee or ranged weapon skill, though you may want to have one of each. Almost all fighters have either Armor, Shield or Dual Weapon skills, so keep the Martial Styles in mind before you spend all of your DP.
Some character classes are more melee oriented, while others are adept at ranged weapons. You may also want to consider that not all fighters are renowned for their ability to wear armor. All weapons and armor have Optimal Strengths for use. If you do not have the Optimal Strength for a weapon, you may still use it, but you will have a time penalty for each attack.
 
Axe
The Axe skill includes the use of one handed and two handed Axes. Many classes of fighters, including Barbarians, Woodsmen, Rangers and Highlanders sometimes use axes as their primary melee weapons. Axemen are specialize in the use of axes, and start with a 30 in Axe, as well as some skill in the use of Armor. Thrown axes are not included with the Axe skill.

Dagger
Daggers are considered to be the primary weapon of Assassins and Zealots, though most magic users find the use of daggers to be a fairly simple task. A fighter who uses daggers may want to learn to wield one in each hand with the Dual Weapon skill. Thrown daggers are not included with the Dagger skill.

Unarmed
The Unarmed skill primarily governs melee combat without any weapons. There are a few weapons that may be used in conjunction with unarmed combat including Cat's Claws, Hand Wraps and Knuckles. Dual Weapon is often a complementary skill for those who aspire to excel in unarmed combat.

Hammer
The Hammer skill includes the use of one handed and two handed Hammers. Barbarians, Woodsmen, and Berserkers often use Hammers. There are several types of hammers, including maces and picks, that are included in the Hammer skill. Thrown hammers are not included in the Hammer skill.

Polearm
The Polearm skill includes all polearms and polearm-like weapons, such as halberds, pitchforks, scythes and glaives. All polearm type weapons are two handed and may not be used with a shield, nor may they be used with the Dual Weapon skill. Armsmen are known for their skill with polearms, though many other fighters may use them. As a fighter with the Polearm skill, Armor may be considered a necessity.

Spear
The Spear skill includes spears and spear-like weapons, such as tridents, pikes, lances and pills. Many spears are two handed, though some of the smaller variants may be used with a shield or with another weapon through the use of the Dual Weapon skill. Pikemen are renowned for their ability with spears, though many other fighters use them. Thrown spears are not included in the Spear skill.

Staff
The Staff skill includes all staves, such as quarterstaves, chacing staves and other types of Staff. Rangers and Hunters are known to sometimes use staves, and many casters find the staff an easy weapon to learn. All Staves are two handed, and may not be used with a shield, nor with the Dual Weapon skill.

Sword
The Sword skill includes all one handed and two handed swords. Use of swords is quite common, though Cavaliers, Swashbucklers, and Duelists tend to specialize in the use of swords exclusively. Rangers, Highlanders, and many other fighters sometimes choose the sword as their primary melee weapon, as it can be used with a shield or with the Dual Weapon skill. Thrown weapons are not included with the Sword skill.

Archery
The Archery skill includes the use of bows such as long bows, short bows and compound bows. Archers are renowned for their skills with a bow, as they have specialized their learning towards its use. Rangers and Marksmen are commonly known to use bows and many other fighters, particularly elves, learn the skill to increase their ranged capabilities.
Those who seek to learn Archery should consider a melee weapon skill in case they are ambushed from nearby. Dexterity is an important factor in the use of bows, though Strength is important for using larger types of bows.

Crossbow
The Crossbow skill includes the use of all sizes and types of crossbows. While many fighters use crossbows, Crossbowmen are known for their amazing accuracy with crossbows and arbalests. Assassins often are thought to use miniature crossbows loaded with poison as a weapon.
The use of crossbows relies on Dexterity for accuracy, but also on Strength, as many of the larger crossbows require a high strength to reload quickly.

Sling
The Sling skill includes the use of all sizes and types of slings. Slings are often considered inferior to crossbows and bows as a sling has a lower effective range. Many casters consider it to be useful as slings are lighter and the skill is easier for them to learn. Some classes of fighters train in the use of slings, particularly Slingers, who specialize in the Sling skill. Highlanders and Hunters sometimes use slings as well.
The use of slings is more reliant on the user's Dexterity than other types of ranged weapons, though a higher Strength will add more force when hits are made, doing more damage.

Thrown
The Thrown weapon skill includes all thrown weapons, such as daggers, stars, darts, hammers, axes and even javelins. Barbarians, Highlanders and Performers often use thrown weapons. Bombadiers are known to have great skill in throwing weapons, as they have specialized their training to learn the art.
Though the effective range of thrown weapons tends to be less than that of bows and crossbows, thrown weapons are much simpler to use and and are more useful to people of high Strength and lower Dexterity.

Armor
The Armor skill measures your character's ability to wear Armor. There are several types of Armor, the least substantial of which is Cloth. Soft Leather is the second type of Armor, which may be worn if your character's Armor skill is at least a 25.
Much like weapons, Armor has an Optimal Strength Rating. Your character may wear armor rated above his or her Strength, but will suffer penalties to casting, evading and hitting. Armor is measured by Armor Encumbrance; each piece worn adds to the overall Armor Encumbrance.
If the total Armor Encumbrance is above the amount your character can wear comfortably, then he or she will suffer penalites to movement and actions. As a caster, armor may affect spellcasting chances even if your character is not over-encumbered. If your character will be casting primarily in combat, avoid wearing armor that matches your maximum armor encumbrance. If you wear armor that is at least two levels lower than the type that would be your maximum encumbrance, then your character should not be adversely affected. (If you can wear Chainmail, you may want to wear Ringmail or a lesser type of armor.)

Dual Weapon
The Dual Weapon skill is not an exclusive skill, and much like Armor, should be purchased with another skill as a primary skill. Two small weapons, each one handed, may be used without penalty if your character has the Dual Weapon skill. Ranged weapons, Polearms and Staves are all two handed and may not be used with Dual Weapon.
The skill used for the weapon you weild limits the effectiveness of the (secondary) weapon in your left hand, as does Dual Weapon. Since shields are always equipped to the left hand, your character will not be able to dual weild and use a shield at once.
 
Shield
The Shield skill includes the use of all types and sizes of shields, though the shield types that may be used are limited by your character's skill. At a 1 skill, your character may use bucklers, while at 25, he or she may use Tilting shields. If you have chosen a two handed weapon for your character's primary melee weapon, keep in mind that a shield may not be used at the same time as a two handed weapon.
Like weapons, shields have an Optimal Strength Rating. If your character's Strength is below the Optimal Strength, then he or she may suffer penalties to using that particular shield. 
 
 
#Magic Skills
 
Schools of magic, Focus and Spellcraft are considered to be Magic Skills. Magic skills are important, particularly to characters who are oriented more towards spellcasting than fighting or other pursuits. As a spellcaster, make sure that you choose at least one spell school. Though some spellcasters are specialized in spell schools, Spellcraft and Focus are important skills to consider before you spend all of your available DP.
Shamanic (primary), Druidic and Bardic are Life Magic while, Necromancy (primary), Summoning and Sorcery are Death Magic. Conjuring (primary), Summoning and Druidic are Terrestrial Magic and Illusion (primary), Bardic and Sorcery are Etherial Magic. Conjuring and Illusion directly oppose each other, and Shamanic and Necromantic magic are direct opposites as well.
For the first, tenth and every tenth level after that, your character learns a free spell. Other spells may be learned through trainers and quests.
 
Bardic
The Bardic skill includes the casting of Bardic Magic. Bardic magic is a Life school as well as an Etherial school, and is considered to be the magic of music. It was first developed by the elves, though any race can excel at Bardic magic. Bardic magic is often most effective when used in a group, as many of the Bardic spells positively affect parties of people.
Protective spells, light healing, and skill and Attribute boosting skills are common types of Bardic magic. The use of instruments is often a boon to a caster of Bardic Magic. Troubadours are the most specialized casters of Bardic magic, combining knowledge of Spellcraft and magic to cast their spells

Conjuring
The Conjuring skill includes the casting of Conjuring magic. Conjuring is a Terrestrial school of magic, and is considered to be the magic of creating tangible objects. It was first developed by gnomes, known for combining their craftwork and magics. Conjuring magic is often most effective before a battle, as minor items and barriers can be cast to aid in the battle without taking casting time in the battle.
Protective barriers, lights and the creation of items are common types of Conjuring magic. Conjurers are the most specialized casters of Conjuring magic, combining knowledge of Spellcraft and magic to cast their spells.

Druidic
The Druidic skill includes the casting of Druidic magic. Druidic is a Life school as well as a Terrestrial school, and is considered to be the magic of nature. It was first developed by the elves in the woodlands of ancient Vormis. Druidic magic is often most effective when dealing with animals or creatures of an animal nature, hostile or friendly.
Calling animals to aid, befriending creatures and light healing are common types of Druidic spells. Druids are the most specialized of Druidic magic, combining Spellcraft and Druidic magic to can their spells.

Illusion
The Illusion skill includes the casting of Illusion magic. Illusion is an Etherial school, and is considered to be the magic of creating intangible visions. The leshy were the first known race to cast Illusion magic, though no one knows when the magic was first used. Illusion magic is often most effective when cast on those with little power to disbelieve, though some spells are subtle enough to only work on those with sufficient intellect to realize that a spell has been cast.
Making illusory beasts, visions of great beauty or terrifying nightmares are common types of Illusion spells. Illusionists are the most specialized casters of Illusion magic, combining knowledge of Spellcraft and Illusion to cast their spells.

Necromancy
The Necromancy skill includes the casting of Necromantic magic. Necromancy is a Death school, and is considered to be the magic of the dead. Though there are no records that indicate who first developed the school, there has been speculation that the dwarves or gnomes created it. Necromancy is often most effective when used in a group, as minions can protect you and your friends from harm.
Raising the dead, summoning spirits and damaging spells are the most common forms of Necromancy spells. Necromancers are the most specialized casters of Necromantic magic, combining knowledge of Spellcraft and Necromancy to cast their spells.

Sorcery
The Sorcery skill includes the casting of Sorcery. The school of Sorcery is a Death school as well as a Etherial school, and is considered to be the magic of fire and brimstone. It was first developed by humans, and records of it exist from over 2000 years ago in the plains of Vormis. Sorcery is most effective when used at range, as it will draw the attention of a foe almost instantly, but with protection, calling a foe to the forefront of a battle may be useful.
Fire, lightning, elemental damaging spells and some barriers are the most common forms of Sorcery spells. Sorcerers are the most specialized caster of Sorcery, combining knowledge of Spellcraft and Sorcery to cast their spells.

Shamanic
The Shamanic skill includes the casting of Shamanic magic. Shamanic magic is a Life school, and is considered to be the magic of life and healing. It is said that the elves or dwarves first created Shamanic magic, but the debate has never been settled. Shamanic magic is most effective when used in a group, as it is hard to heal oneself while being attacked.
Healing, resurrecting and some protectives are among the most common types of Shamanic magic. Shamans are the most specialized casters of Shamanic magic, combining knowledge of Shamanic magic and Spellcraft to cast their spells.

Spellcraft
Spellcraft is not a skill that can be used to directly harm a foe or protect someone. Instead, Spellcraft is the knowledge of how spells work and how to cast them with a better chance of success. Most of those who are primarily caster classes have some knowledge of Spellcraft, specialists have a level of 10 or more in the skill. While Spellcraft may aid in the creation of magical items, it is not very useful for those who do not cast spells of any school.
Spellcraft primarily allows a caster to designate more power to any given spell without having to cast a higher level spell. Depending on the amount of Mana that a caster wishes to use, he or she can decide to cast at full power, minimum power, or in between, depending on his or her Spellcraft and spell school skill.
 
Summoning
The Summoning skill includes the casting of Summoning magic. Summoning is a Death school as well as a Terrestrial school, and is considered to be the magic of calling and controlling beasts. It was first developed by humans, and records of it exist from over 2000 years ago in the plains of Vormis. Summoning is most effective when used in a group, as not all foes will assume that the creature is the main threat, though it can be used wth care when one is alone.
Calling creatures, some spirits and controlling creatures are the most common forms of Summoning spells. Summoners are the most specialized caster of Summoning, combining knowledge of Spellcraft with Summoning magic to cast their spells.

Focus
The Focus skill has two effects: It decreases the mana cost of spells cast, and also increases your accuracy with ranged attacks - both magical and mundane. Focus represents your mental and physical self control, and is extremely useful to spellcasters that have many ranged attack spells such as Sorcerers, excellent for ranged weapon characters, and still a boon to other caster types.
The better you are at Focus, the less mana the spell will actually cost when you cast. Focus does not reduce or increase your casting time, chance for success, or the initial mana cost of a spell. Focus will not give you any additional spells. Since casters gain two benefits from a high focus, they are the ones most likely to raise it to the highest levels, but Archers with a high Focus skill can strike lethal blows from a great distance.
The highest level of focusing skill that you may attain is 500, at which point you are considered to be a Grandmaster of that skill.
 
 
#Crafting Skills
 
Skills that allow a character to produce items are considered Craft Skills. All craft skills are used by spending Production Points (PP) and using assigned materials to make items such as weapons, scrolls, potions, armor and ammunition. Craft skills can also be used to identify relevant types of items, and add to your character's Lore skill when Identifying particular types of item. 
Armorsmithing, Weaponsmithing and Fletching may allow your character to repair relevant types of items in addition to making new items. Characters who have crafting skills do not have to rely on others to repair things for them, and several character classes are based solely on knowledge of Crafting Skills. Crafting skills are slightly less expensive in DP cost than Martial or Magic Skills.
Crafting Skills are slightly less expensive in DP cost than Martial or Magic skills. You may also increase your character's skill through practice. If your character is successful in making an item, the Crafting Skill you used may increase without having to spend DP. You must buy at least the first point of skill through DP, either in character generation or in the game world.
 
Armorsmithing
The Armorsmithing skill includes the creation and repair of metal armor, as well as creation of needed parts for specific types of armor. Armorsmithing skill aids in Identifying pieces of heavy armor, though Lore and Mining skills may prove useful. As a fighter, the ability to repair armor in the field is valuable.
Armorsmithing can not be used to create light armor (cloth or leather). Instead, the Tailoring skill is used to make and repair light armor.

Tailoring
Tailoring governs the creation of light armor, including cloth and leather armors. The Tailoring skill allows a character make cloth, to repair and create leather and cloth armor, and to attempt to Identify cloth and leather armors. A Tailor is one who is specialized in the skill of Tailoring. Lore, Hunting and Herbalism can all be useful skills to a Tailor.
As a person learns more about Tailoring, they will be able to make better protecting armor with different types of cloth and leathers.

Fletching
The Fletching skill governs the art of making bows, crossbows, slings, and ammunition for all three. The Fletching skill also allows you to repair and identify bows, crossbows, slings and ammunition. As a Bowyer or Fletcher, Hunting and Herbalism may be useful as secondary skills. If your character uses ranged ammunition, you may want to consider this skill to save on the cost of ammunition.
Characters skilled in Fletching may also create wooden weapons.
As a person learns more Fletching skill, they will be able to craft better, larger and more elaborate types of ranged weapons and ammunition from available materials.

Weaponsmithing
The Weaponsmithing skill includes the repair and creation of weapons, not including bows, crossbows and slings. Weaponsmithing also aids in the Identification of weapons that can be crafted with the skill. Mining, Lore and Herbalism may all be useful skills to a Weaponsmith.
As a person learns more Weaponsmithing skill, they will be able to make better and more elaborate weapons out of exotic metals and woods, as well as gemstones and even bones.

Alchemy
The Alchemy skill includes the use of herbs to make potions, tonics, salves and elixirs that can have a variety of purposes and effects. Since potions, tonics, salves and elixirs can be used for healing, even in combat, many adventurers find those types of items to be useful and are often interested in purchasing them. Alchemists may find the Herbalism, Hunting, Mining, Search and Lore skills to be particularly useful.
As a person gains more skill in Alchemy, they may craft better and stronger brews which can boost Skills and Attributes, as well as providing healing. An Alchemist is someone who is specialized in Alchemy.

Lapidary
The Lapidary Skill can be used to make plain jewelry from metals, and to set gems into previously created jewelry. In some cases, this jewelry can have slight magical properties. The Lapidary skill can be used to create jewelry that can be Enchanted. Items crafted through the Lapidary skill are often worth much more than their component parts. The Mining, Lore and Search skills are useful secondary skills to a Jeweler.
As a person learns more of the art of making jewelry, they can work with better materials to create more elaborate jewelry from available components. Characters of the Jeweler class are specialized in Lapidary.

Calligraphy
Calligraphy is a type of writing, commonly used for the creation of scrolls and important documents. The Calligraphy skill covers the creation of inks and the creation of scrolls and books, both magical and mundane. Scrolls can be used to store spells for later release. A scroll can allow a fighter to cast a spell without needing any Magic skills or allow a spellcaster to cast higher level spells or spells of a different school than the school(s) they know. Lore, Spellcraft and a Spell School are important secondary skills to have as a Calligrapher.
As a person learns more about Calligraphy, they can scribe stronger magic to scrolls and work with different materials to craft their books and scrolls.

Enchanting
The Enchanting skill can be used to imbue mundane weapons, armor, jewelry and other items with magical powers. A character skilled at Enchanting can use a variety of types of components prepared through the Hunting, Mining and Herbalism skills to apply the properties of the components to the target of their craft. Unlike other Craft skills, Enchanting requires a great deal of knowledge of the items you are combining, so the Lore skill and the other Crafting skills are essential. An Enchanter is one who specializes in the skill of Enchanting.
 
 
#Gathering Skills
 
Skills that allow a character to gather items for use with Craft Skills are considered Gathering Skills. While Gathering skills are not used to make items directly, they can be used to find vital and rare materials. 
Gathering skills can add to your character's chance of Indentifying an item which is commonly found through the use of a particular Gathering skill. Herbalism allows you to find plants and wood, Hunting allows you to find useful animal parts, and Mining allows you to find metals and gems.
Gathering skills cost less than Martial or Magic skills in DP, but like Craft skills, they can also be learned through practice. If you successfully find an item, there is a chance you will gain skill. Some areas are harder to harvest in than others, and only by challenging your skills can you raise them without a trainer.
 
Herbalism
Herbalism is the art of finding and collecting herbs for use in Enchanting, Alchemy, Calligraphy and other crafting skills. Herbalism allows your character to find a variety of herbs and types of wood in the wild. It also adds to your character's Lore skill for purposes of Identifying herbs and woods.
An Herbalist is one who has specialized in finding and identifying growing plants. Search, Lore, and Alchemy or Fletching may be useful secondary skills for an Herbalist to consider.

Hunting
The Hunting skill includes knowing what animal parts are useful for a wide variety of things and finding those that are useful. This skill mainly aids in finding useful items that the untrained eye might overlook. While these items cannot immediately be used, a Huntsman can collect many ingredients for use with the Alchemy, Weaponsmithing, Armorsmithing and Fletching skills, and thus is often a useful person to have around when fighting rare beasts that contain possible components.
As a person learns more Huntsman skill, they will be able to find rarer and more obscure items, and they will have a better chance of finding them in a useful state. Lore and Search are complementary skills for a Huntsman.

Mining
The Mining skill represents the knowledge needed to find and Identify rocks, gems, minerals and metals. Though finding some items may require the use of mining tools, many inexpensive stones can be found on the surface, or in cavern walls without tools.
A Miner is one who has specialized in the art of Mining. Since metals and gemstones are used for many things, including Alchemy, Weaponsmithing, Armorsmithing, Lapidary and spellcastering, one who is skilled in mining can make a reasonable amount of coin with their skills.
As a person becomes a more effective miner, they will become more efficient and skilled at gathering various types of metals and gems.
 
 
#Worldly Skills
 
Skills that do not directly affect combat, can not be used to make or repair items, and that are not languages are considered to be Worldly Skills. Worldly skills cost less to learn than Crafting skills, Martial Skills and Magic Skills, and are excellent for making a well-rounded character that is more than a series of numbers. The description of individual skills can be viewed by selecting each skill. Some character classes are based on these skills as a primary requirement.
 
Bargaining
The Bargaining skill represents your character's ability to get a good price for any item that is sold to or bought from a shopkeeper. Bargaining is a passive skill, as it always in effect. Intelligence is an important factor in Bargaining, so don't forget to consider your character's Attributes when learning skills.
Merchants, Scoundrels and Sycophants are well known for their ability to haggle and bargain for better prices and trades with this skill.

Camping
The Camping skill represents how well your character can set up a safe camp that will allow you and your fellows to rest effectively. The Camping skill is most effective for those who travel in groups, as everyone in a party may benefit from the increased physical and mental healing that even one person with a Camping skill can provide. When one person sets up a camp, everyone in the party who sits with that person will recover faster from any wounds or other afflictions that they may have.
Wardens, Woodsmen, and Explorers commonly have knowledge of how to set up a camp effectively. Rangers, Barbarians and Druids are sometimes skilled in Camping as well.

First Aid
The First Aid skill allows one to staunch and possibly heal the wounds of oneself or others; as long as the wounds are greivous enough. If the target of First Aid is more than half as healthy as he or she can be, then First Aid will not help. However, in conjunction with Shamanic magic, Camping skills, and other types of healing, First Aid can be very effective at a low overall cost in time and materials. Barbers, Healers, Clerics and Friars are all known for their ability to heal through First Aid.

Lore
The Lore skill represents knowledge of the world around your character. Someone with knowledge of Lore may try to Identify items and may find interesting information in places where others find nothing. Lore is a key to unlocking the secrets of magic, mainly in the case of items.
Scholars, Philosophers, and many types of magic users are skilled in Lore. Mages, Bards, Merchants, Sages, Witchs and Wizards often have some knowledge of Lore.

Pick Locks
The Pick Locks skill allows your character to attempt to pick locks on doors, chests and other locked items. While many know the very basics of picking locks, Thieves and and Bandits often have studied the art extensively. Items such as Lock Picks and other tools may help a character with this skill. The Traps skill may be useful for a character planning to Pick Locks to get into places where the inhabitants may not like the intrusions of others.

Scouting
The Scouting skill is used to find hidden creatures and people, and to appraise an adversaries threat value to oneself and to one's party. In some cases, a Scout may be able to determine information about a creature or person that others cannot see, such as vulnerabilities, resistances, social habits, physical strength, or other useful bits of information. The Scouting skill is used to counter another individual's Stealth skill.
Scouts, Explorers, Thieves, Woodsmen and Wardens are among those who are often known to have scouting expertise. When combined with Stealth, the Scouting skill can be a valuable information gathering tool for a group.

Search
The Search skill is used to determine whether your character can find hidden objects or treasure that may be nearby. In the case of Huntsman, Lapidary, and Herbalist items, Search adds to one's ability to find hidden objects. Searching relies heavily on Intelligence, though the trained eye will find more than the untrained, regardless of Intelligence.
When you choose to Search, your character is searching the nearby area, an area of approximately 3 meters

Stealth
The Stealth skill is used to determine how well a character can hide from sight or detection, even while in plain view. The Scout skill is used to counter an individual's Stealth. Intelligence, Scout and Stealth are all factors in effectively using Stealth. Not all creatures use sight as their primary means of finding others, so the Stealth skill represents knowledge of how to hide from many forms of detection.

Traps
The Traps skill is a passive skill, as it is assumed that an individual with the ability to recognize traps and disarm them will attempt to find them automatically. If a character with the Traps skill finds a trap, that person may choose to examine the Trap and to try to disarm it. Most traps reset after a period of time, so a character with the Traps skill may need to disarm a particular trap repeatedly. Once a nearby Trap is recognized, the finder may be able to determine what type of trap it is and how dangerous it may be.

 
#Language Skills
 
There are 6 common languages of the civilized people of Vormis, and each is covered by a Language skill. Language skills are least expensive skills in terms of DP. All characters start with a 100 skill in Praxic, the common tongue of Vormis. A 100 skill allows your character to chat or speak that language fluently. A 150 skill allows your character to read and write the language fluently. Each language is associated with specific races, so all characters also have a 100 skill in their native tongue. 
 
Aeolandis
Aeolandis is the native language of the leshy. Since the leshy developed Illusion magic, many of the older texts and scrolls involving the art of Illusion are written in Aeolandis. Aeolandis is difficult for some to comprehend, as it is very complex and has many sounds that are foreign to the other races of Vormis. Linguists, Poets and other classes that often deal with languages other than the common tongue of Vormis, Praxic, may find the Aeolandis skill to be useful. All leshy are fluent in speaking Aeolandis.

Heiroform
Heiroform is the native language of the elves. Many ancient texts about Druidic and Bardic magic and histories of the civilized elves are written in Heiroform. Heiroform is a flowing and sweet sounding language so many Bardic spells are in some form of Heiroform, though casting of Bardic magic does not require knowledge of Heiroform. Linguists, Poets, and other classes that often deal with languages other than the common tongue may find the Heiroform skill to be useful. All elves are fluent in speaking Heiroform.

High Gundis
High Gundis is the native language of the orcs and ogres. As orcs and ogres were recently considered civilized races of Vormis, there are very few written texts in High Gundis, and no magic schools make extensive use of the language. High Gundis is a useful language for those who wish to speak to some of the orcs, ogres, and related creatures in the wilderness of Vormis. It is a very gutteral language, difficult for some people to speak and understand.
According to the histories, the orcs and ogres developed their own language to be able to hide the meanings of their words from other races before they were allowed to venture into cities and towns as citizens. All ogres and orcs are fluent in speaking High Gundis.

Old Praxic
Old Praxic is the language of the ancient humans from the time of Praxus, a great leader of the human tribes over 2000 years ago. Praxus is said to have brought a common culture and language to the scattered tribes of humans, uniting them into a civilization that continued to develop long after his death. Old Praxic is not particularly gutteral or flowing, but formed a basis for the common tongue of Vormis, Praxic.
Traces of Old Praxic are evident in Sorcery and Summoning spells, and the language is prevalent in the first written histories of the ancient humans. Old Praxic is a common tongue for those who are interested in histories and linguistic pursuits. All humans are fluent in speaking Old Praxic.

Praxic
Praxic is the common tongue of modern Vormis. All of the civilized races, elves, ogres, orcs, dwarves, humans, gnomes and leshy are fluent in speaking the Praxic tongue. While many modern texts and scrolls are written in Praxic, scholarly works tend to be scribed in the older languages.
Learning more of the Praxic language is of use to those who are interested in scholarly, linguistic or noble pursuits, but does not reveal many of the historical aspects of Vormis.

Runic
Runic is the native language of the dwarves and gnomes, named after the elaborate set of runes that form its alphabet. Many of the ancient dwarven histories are scribed in Runic, either on scrolls or stone tablets. Gnomes have also traditionally used Runic to write their official documents.
Shamanic, Conjuring and Necromantic spells all show roots in the ancient forms of the Runic language. Many ruins have stones inscribed with Runic messages, some more cryptic than others. All dwarves and gnomes are fluent in speaking Runic.
